# truck-price-prediction-with-time-variant
This is a truck price prediction model trained over 4,00,000+ dataset keys containing a time varient. The dataset has approximately 75 percent missing data. Before training the whole dataset is cleaned and enriched by filling all the numerical values missing column by their median and the string type data has been converted into categorical data and then they are converted in numerical form. The whole model is trained by RandomForestRegressor imported from sklearn.ensemble. and optimised by RandomSearchCV and tuned over various hyperparameter.
